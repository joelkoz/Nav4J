# Nav4J
An application framework for building an embedded navigation system using [Map4J](https://github.com/joelkoz/Map4J).

See the "src/examples/java" directory for a working code example.

## Background

This project aims to create an application framework for creating a navigation application on an embedded device. It's
target platform is currently a Raspberry Pi, though at the moment, there is no Pi specific code.

Map rendering is performed by my other project: [Map4J](https://github.com/joelkoz/Map4J).
